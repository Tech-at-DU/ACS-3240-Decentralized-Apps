## Course Description

In this course, students will learn how to utilize a fresh, exciting new development paradigm that harnesses the power of peer-to-peer applications and distributed architectures. This course begins by demystifying common jargon in the modern-day blockchain ecosystem, then establishes best practices for developing consensus based products and services.

Students will learn how to write smart contracts, tokens, and other cryptographic assets using smart contracts written in Solidity --- quickly enabling each student to invent and produce the decentralized holdings of their dreams!

## Prerequisites

- [ACS 2230](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-2230-Server-Side-Architectures)
- [ACS 2130](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-2130-Core-Data-Structures)



## Learning Outcomes

**By the end of the course, you will be able to...**

1. Compare and contrast centralized and decentralized protocols, and determine the best use case for each technique.
1. Dive deeper into common decentralized protocols used daily by all developers.
1. Identify and describe different standards for token-based assets and their specific use cases on the blockchain.
1. Develop Smart Contracts and full-stack dApps using the Solidity protocol.
1. Speak professionally on the practical applications of decentralized applications and protocols.

### Holidays & Offline Sessions

On the following days this term, our class will **NOT be meeting online** on Zoom:

1. `Tuesday, April 02, 2024`: Class Holiday _(to sync with April 01 campus holiday)_
2. `Tuesday, April 23, 2024`: Lab Day for [MakeCoin Project]

## Evaluation

We will be using Gradescope this term, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope. As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Dominican University email, and your password can be changed at <https://gradescope.com/reset_password>. The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

**To pass this course you must meet the following requirements**:

- Complete all required [tutorials](#tutorials), [assignments](#assignments), and [projects](#final-project).
- Score `>36` points on the [MakeCoin Project], according to the [MakeCoin Rubric].
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy.
- Make up all classwork from all absences.

### Tutorials

- **[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io)** is an interactive school that teaches you all things technical about blockchains! Learn to make smart contracts in Solidity by making your own crypto-collectibles game.
<!-- - **[Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)**: Complete at least 10 out of 26 tutorials. You choose! -->

### Final Project

[MakeCoin Project]: Design and mint your very own [ERC-20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/er20), [ERC-721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721), [ERC-777](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc777), or [ERC-1155](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155) assets, then use them in a custom, full-stack distributed application!

### Final Presentation

The delivery of a live or pre-recorded presentation is required to pass this course. **Presentations will be delivered on our final day of class**.

Your **five minute presentation** should focus on the **experience you gained** and **lessons you learned** while implementing your final project in this course.

**Your final presentation will be evaluated based on the ACS Presentation Rubric. You must earn an average of 2.5 on the rubric to pass**.
